# Lane A (Brokers) — decision log for PM/John

Worker session appends here; PM concatenates into DECISION-LOG.md.

## 2026-07-10 — bizmls crack applied via NATIONAL search, not per-org probing

- Probed 38 org-code guesses at `bizmls.com/<org>/businesses`: only `bbf` and
  `gabb` exist. GABB's bizmls area is a **member login portal** (aw-login.asp),
  not public listings — its public inventory is the Webflow API we already
  scrape. No other state association has a public bizmls org page.
- Better find: `folder=BIZMLS&state=ALL` (the bizmls.com homepage search)
  returns the ENTIRE cross-state member inventory in one GET — 2,256 rows.
  Shipped as source `bizmls` (reuses generalized `sources/bbf.js`), excluding
  FL rows since `bbf` is authoritative there. **+143 listings (84 Texas), 1 new
  Tier 1 on first run.**
- ➡️ Queue task "apply bizmls crack to other state associations" is COMPLETE in
  spirit: the national search already carries every member listing; there are
  no other public per-association portals to crack. PM can mark it done.

## 2026-07-10 — 4 benched sources UNBLOCKED (all had hidden JSON/AJAX backends)

Probing "check the network tab first" paid off — four sources the roster had
benched for dedicated JS sessions turned out to have clean data feeds:

| Source | New adapter | Backend found | Listings | Tier 1/2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Murphy Business | `murphy.js` | WP admin-ajax (`ajax_new_business_search_result`), per-load api_token | 456 | 1 / 14 |
| Sun Acquisitions | `sun.js` | SSR index + detail crawl (no asking price; EBITDA lines) | 6 | 1 / 0 |
| BizBen | `bizben.js` | Public AWS API Gateway JSON (`Prod/top-business`); 2 pools (fast_track true/false) | 4,433 | 5 / 9 |
| First Choice (FCBB) | `fcbb.js` | JSON API behind Duda (`api.fcbb.com/Fcbb/GetListings`, static header tokens) | 825 | 8 / 10 |

- **BizBen pagination gotcha**: `pagination_token` param takes the DOUBLE-JSON-
  encoded `nextPageKey`; no guessed param name worked — had to capture the
  site's own XHR. Two disjoint pools (`fast_track=true`≈300 paid, `false`≈4,100)
  that never auto-transition — adapter runs both.
- **BizBen + FCBB both ship broker contact** (name/phone/email/license) →
  1,000+ broker rows synced. Useful for Phase 5/6 outreach, not just multiples.
- **Lesson reinforced**: `probe_net_full.js <url>` before assuming a JS site
  needs headless rendering. 4/4 benched "hard" sources were actually API-fed.
- ➡️ SOURCES.md "BENCHED" table is now stale for Murphy, Sun Acquisitions,
  BizBen, FCBB — PM should move them to LIVE (adapter count 10 → 15, incl.
  `bizmls`). ~4k of the new listings are CA/other market-multiples data;
  ~40 new relevant thesis-fit listings, 15 Tier 1.

## 2026-07-10 — new-source hunt: HedgeStone built; recon of ~18 candidates

Built **HedgeStone** (`hedgestone.js`) — first net-new source beyond the
roster. SSR WordPress SAE-listings plugin, 720 listings, 3 Tier 1 + 8 Tier 2.

Recon on the rest (two `probe_new_sources` batches), all NOT built:
- **We Sell Restaurants** — clean public API
  (`api.wesellrestaurants.com/wsr-rebuild-prod/api/restaurants/business-for-sale`),
  would be a ~1hr adapter. OFF-THESIS (restaurants) but the strategy note says
  brokers = max-coverage multiples intel at min cost. ⬆️ **DECISION FOR JOHN/PM:**
  build it for restaurant-vertical multiples data, or skip to keep the DB
  thesis-focused? I left it unbuilt pending that call.
- **Morgan & Westfield** — clean `.business-for-sale` SSR cards, thesis-sized
  deals ($1–6M, disclosed revenue/cash flow) BUT only 7 public listings (M&A
  advisor, most deals confidential). Too low-volume to justify an adapter now;
  revisit if they grow their public board.
- **Peterson Acquisitions** — big $ figures on page ($15M–$68M) but listings
  aren't exposed as crawlable links/API (JS-embedded). Needs a dedicated
  session; deal sizes skew above thesis. Benched.
- **Calhoun, Benchmark, Principium, Empire, Neumann, CBC, Certified BB** — no
  public listings grid (404s, advisor landing pages, or dead host). Confirmed
  no-go, matching roster's "M&A advisors, no public grid" note.
- Sunbelt Atlanta uses per-city subdomains w/ callrail widgets — the national
  `sunbelt` adapter already covers this network; no incremental value.
