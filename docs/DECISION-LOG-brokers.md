# Lane A (Brokers) — decision log for PM/John

Worker session appends here; PM concatenates into DECISION-LOG.md.

## 2026-07-10 — bizmls crack applied via NATIONAL search, not per-org probing

- Probed 38 org-code guesses at `bizmls.com/<org>/businesses`: only `bbf` and
  `gabb` exist. GABB's bizmls area is a **member login portal** (aw-login.asp),
  not public listings — its public inventory is the Webflow API we already
  scrape. No other state association has a public bizmls org page.
- Better find: `folder=BIZMLS&state=ALL` (the bizmls.com homepage search)
  returns the ENTIRE cross-state member inventory in one GET — 2,256 rows.
  Shipped as source `bizmls` (reuses generalized `sources/bbf.js`), excluding
  FL rows since `bbf` is authoritative there. **+143 listings (84 Texas), 1 new
  Tier 1 on first run.**
- ➡️ Queue task "apply bizmls crack to other state associations" is COMPLETE in
  spirit: the national search already carries every member listing; there are
  no other public per-association portals to crack. PM can mark it done.

## 2026-07-10 — 4 benched sources UNBLOCKED (all had hidden JSON/AJAX backends)

Probing "check the network tab first" paid off — four sources the roster had
benched for dedicated JS sessions turned out to have clean data feeds:

| Source | New adapter | Backend found | Listings | Tier 1/2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Murphy Business | `murphy.js` | WP admin-ajax (`ajax_new_business_search_result`), per-load api_token | 456 | 1 / 14 |
| Sun Acquisitions | `sun.js` | SSR index + detail crawl (no asking price; EBITDA lines) | 6 | 1 / 0 |
| BizBen | `bizben.js` | Public AWS API Gateway JSON (`Prod/top-business`); 2 pools (fast_track true/false) | 4,433 | 5 / 9 |
| First Choice (FCBB) | `fcbb.js` | JSON API behind Duda (`api.fcbb.com/Fcbb/GetListings`, static header tokens) | 825 | 8 / 10 |

- **BizBen pagination gotcha**: `pagination_token` param takes the DOUBLE-JSON-
  encoded `nextPageKey`; no guessed param name worked — had to capture the
  site's own XHR. Two disjoint pools (`fast_track=true`≈300 paid, `false`≈4,100)
  that never auto-transition — adapter runs both.
- **BizBen + FCBB both ship broker contact** (name/phone/email/license) →
  1,000+ broker rows synced. Useful for Phase 5/6 outreach, not just multiples.
- **Lesson reinforced**: `probe_net_full.js <url>` before assuming a JS site
  needs headless rendering. 4/4 benched "hard" sources were actually API-fed.
- ➡️ SOURCES.md "BENCHED" table is now stale for Murphy, Sun Acquisitions,
  BizBen, FCBB — PM should move them to LIVE (adapter count 10 → 15, incl.
  `bizmls`). ~4k of the new listings are CA/other market-multiples data;
  ~40 new relevant thesis-fit listings, 15 Tier 1.

## 2026-07-10 — new-source hunt: HedgeStone built; recon of ~18 candidates

Built **HedgeStone** (`hedgestone.js`) — first net-new source beyond the
roster. SSR WordPress SAE-listings plugin, 720 listings, 3 Tier 1 + 8 Tier 2.

Recon on the rest (two `probe_new_sources` batches), all NOT built:
- **We Sell Restaurants** — clean public API
  (`api.wesellrestaurants.com/wsr-rebuild-prod/api/restaurants/business-for-sale`),
  would be a ~1hr adapter. OFF-THESIS (restaurants) but the strategy note says
  brokers = max-coverage multiples intel at min cost. ⬆️ **DECISION FOR JOHN/PM:**
  build it for restaurant-vertical multiples data, or skip to keep the DB
  thesis-focused? I left it unbuilt pending that call.
- **Morgan & Westfield** — clean `.business-for-sale` SSR cards, thesis-sized
  deals ($1–6M, disclosed revenue/cash flow) BUT only 7 public listings (M&A
  advisor, most deals confidential). Too low-volume to justify an adapter now;
  revisit if they grow their public board.
- **Peterson Acquisitions** — big $ figures on page ($15M–$68M) but listings
  aren't exposed as crawlable links/API (JS-embedded). Needs a dedicated
  session; deal sizes skew above thesis. Benched.
- **Calhoun, Benchmark, Principium, Empire, Neumann, CBC, Certified BB** — no
  public listings grid (404s, advisor landing pages, or dead host). Confirmed
  no-go, matching roster's "M&A advisors, no public grid" note.
- Sunbelt Atlanta uses per-city subdomains w/ callrail widgets — the national
  `sunbelt` adapter already covers this network; no incremental value.

## 2026-07-10 — Lane A session summary (for PM merge)

Entire Lane A queue cleared. Branch `lane/brokers`, 9 commits, ready to merge.

**New adapters (6):** `bizmls` (national bizmls, +143), `murphy` (456),
`sun` (6), `bizben` (4,433), `fcbb` (825), `hedgestone` (720 — net-new source).
**Enrichment:** `transworld` now pulls broker contacts on thesis-fit listings.

**DB impact:** ~7,000 new listing rows (bulk = CA/national market-multiples
data), ~40 new thesis-relevant, ~20 new Tier 1. ~1,100 new broker contacts
(BizBen/FCBB/Transworld) — usable for Phase 5/6 outreach.

**New `scrape_sources` rows** (added directly to DB, so a fresh `run_supabase`
picks them up): bizmls, murphy, sunacquisitions, bizben, fcbb, hedgestone.
Adapter count 10 → 16.

**PM action items:**
1. Merge `lane/brokers` → main; the config.json additions + 6 new
   `sources/*.js` are self-contained (no web/ or Sidebar.tsx touched).
2. SOURCES.md is stale: move Murphy/Sun/BizBen/FCBB out of BENCHED → LIVE;
   add HedgeStone + bizmls; note Transworld broker enrichment.
3. **Decision for John:** build We Sell Restaurants (clean API, off-thesis
   restaurant multiples) — yes/no? (see above).
4. Daily-run cost/time: Transworld enrichment adds ~4.5 min (150 detail
   fetches). BizBen full run ~3 min. All within a nightly window but worth
   knowing. Consider lowering `max_detail_enrich` if the 6am job gets tight.

## 2026-07-10 (cont.) — post-merge round: VR + Franchise Resales

After PM merged the first 6 adapters to main, continued the source hunt.

- **VR Business Brokers** (`vr.js`) — UNBENCHED. The corporate
  /businesses-for-sale/ page DOES aggregate all franchise-office inventory
  (roster note said "per-franchise domains only" — wrong). SSR cards, WP Views
  pagination. 366 listings, 3 Tier 2. No cash flow on cards (asking/coverage
  data). The homepage "suspicious injected scripts" note was a false alarm.
- **Franchise Resales** (`franchiseresales.js`) — NEW. Franchise-resale board,
  74 green/home-services resales crawled (of 606 total; green_only filter).
  JSON-LD price + brand, body-text cash flow.
  ⚠️ **RELEVANCE-CONFIG NOTE FOR JOHN:** only 1 of 74 passed the thesis screen.
  Many green franchises were dropped because the DB screen keyword list
  (screen_profiles, UI-editable) lacks common trade terms — notably **"painting"
  / "painters"** and **"restore"** (list has "restoration" but not the bare
  "restore" that ServiceMaster/CertaPro use). Adding those to the Green Industry
  Default profile would recover ~15–20 real home-services targets already in the
  DB (not just from this source). I did NOT edit screen_profiles (shared data) —
  flagging for John/PM to update via the Screen Criteria editor.
- Recon also cleared (no public grid / off-thesis / parked): BusinessMart,
  BizNexus (GoHighLevel funnel), Principium (green M&A ADVISOR — no public
  listings, educational content only), Truforte, Crowne Atlantic, Apex, The
  Firm, Calder (cert error). Sunbelt search-page 404 (national `sunbelt`
  adapter already covers it).

**Adapter count now 16 → 18** (vr, franchiseresales). Branch has 15 commits.
